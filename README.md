# profilic-client
A simple set of boostrap-based UI components for rapid application prototyping.
Note: profilic-UI is built to work with *[profilic-client](https://github.com/lululeon/profilic-client)*, which in turn works with *[profilic-server](https://github.com/lululeon/profilic-server)*. Feel free to sit the UI widgets on an entirely different stack, if you like them.

# Widgets
- Login-aware Navbar
- Signup Widget
- Login Widget

Better documentation to come.
